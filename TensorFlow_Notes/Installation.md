# Starting to TensorFlow

## Introduction

As the outstanding performance of _AlphaGo_, AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, such these words become more and more popular. Firstly, I am going to introduce the relationship between AI, deep learning and machine learning.

__AI__, artificial intelligence is proposed in 1956. Scientists dream of creating a robot that can think like human-beings. Artificial Intelligence contains many fields: expert system, machine learning, computer vision, etc..

__Machine Learning__ is an approach to AI. The basic concept is ultilizing algorithms to extract and learn information form data and then generalize models that work well to real-world issues.

__Deep Learning__ is a deep neural network with mutiple hidden layers based on supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods. Deep learning is a method to do machine learning.
